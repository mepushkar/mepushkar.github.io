I am a group member at [SUCSHM Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/iitdprakhargupta/) and Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) in the department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) pursuing my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Prakhar Gupta. My research focuses on developing flexoelectricity based smart metamaterials. I am also interested in mechanics of continua and analysis of slender structures both analyticallly and numerially (Involving but not limited to Finite element Methods).
