I am a group member at [SUCSHM Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/iitdprakhargupta/) and Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) in the department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) pursuing my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Prakhar Gupta. I have done my masters in Stress and Vibration analysis from NIT Bhopal and bachelors from AKTU Lucknow.<br />

My research revolves round development of smart metamaterials using principles of continuum mechanics and variational calculus. My research interests also involve Modeling of slender elastic structures that undergo large deformations and involve multiphysical interactions. I also have a keen interest in developing finite element codes for solving nonlinear structures mentioned above.
